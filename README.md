A json maker for problem generation via [toebes.com](https://toebes.com/codebusters/) for Science Olympiad 🤮🤮🤮 Codebusters Event 😃😃😃




## Usage

**0.** Open the Terminal app


**1.** Navigate to wherever you want to store this project. I recommend Documents. 
```
cd Documents
```


**2.** Check that you have git installed
```
git --version
```
If it outputs a version, you have git installed; continue to step 3.

If it says that the command is not found or not recognized, then you need to install git. Follow the instructions for downloading git for your corresponding operating system from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Once it's correctly installed, the above command should output a version.



**3.** Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/one-big-unicorn/toebees
cd toebees
```


**4.** Check that you have Python 3 installed; if either of the following lines output "Python 3.x.x", you're good

`python --version`    or    `python3 --version`

If neither did, download the release for your operating system from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).



**5.** Run it! There are a couple presets you can use, otherwise make your test following the given format. 

`python main.py`    or    `python3 main.py`

Note: you can force-exit the program any time with Ctrl+C


**6.** Go to [toebes.com](https://toebes.com/codebusters/TestManage.html) and scroll to the bottom of the page. 
Select 'Import Tests from File' > Select File > Navigate to wherever you cloned the repository > toebees > jsons > yourtest.json


**7.** Toebes will probably display that your test has a billion errors—just ignore them.
Click 'Randomize Order' on the top left if you wish to randomize.


**8.** Click 'Test Packet' at the top, then click 'Print'.


**9.** Save as PDF > email it to yourself using your school gmail account > print it out during 5th period > piss off Mrs. Dudley for using all the printer ink.

## To-Do (for me)
| Status | Task |
| :---: | :------  |
|❌      | update generation - patristos must be encoded with K1 or K2 |
|❌      | update generation - xenocrypts must be encoded with K1 or K2 |
|❌      | update generation - cryptanalysis of the Nihilist Cipher with a “crib” that is no shorter than double than the length of the keyword used |
|❌      | add new cipher - 5x5 Checkerboard Cipher decode |
|❌      | add new cipher - 5x5 Checkerboard Cipher cryptanalysis |
