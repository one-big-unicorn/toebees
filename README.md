# toebees

A json maker for problem generation via [toebes.com](https://toebes.com/codebusters/) for Science Olympiad 🤮🤮🤮 Codebusters Event 😃😃😃




## Usage

1. Open the Terminal app

2. Navigate to wherever you want to store this project. I recommend Documents. 
`cd Documents`

3. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/one-big-unicorn/toebees
cd toebees
```

4. Check that you have Python 3 installed
`python --version`

5. Install packages
```
pip install json
pip install random
```
6. Run it! There are a couple presets you can use, otherwise make your test following the format
`python main.py`

Note: If it's ever taking like over 5 seconds to generate (cause you requested 1000 baconians), you can exit the program with Ctrl+C

7. Go to [toebes.com](https://toebes.com/codebusters/TestManage.html) and scroll to the bottom of the page. 
Select 'Import Tests from File' > Select File > Navigate to wherever you cloned the repository > toebees > jsons > yourtest.json

8. Toebes will probably display that your test has a billion errors—just ignore them.
Click 'Randomize Order' on the top left if you wish to randomize.

9. Click 'Test Packet' at the top, then click 'Print'.

10. Save as PDF > email it to yourself using your school gmail account > print it out during 5th period > piss off Mrs. Dudley for using all the printer ink.
