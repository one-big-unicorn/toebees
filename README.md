# toebees

A json maker for problem generation via [toebes.com](https://toebes.com/codebusters/) for Science Olympiad 🤮🤮🤮 Codebusters Event 😃😃😃




## Usage

1. Open the Terminal app

2. Navigate to wherever you want to store this project. I recommend Documents. 
```
cd Documents
```

3. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/one-big-unicorn/toebees
cd toebees
```

4. Check that you have Python 3 installed
```
python --version
```

5. Install packages
```
pip install json
pip install random
```
6. Run it! There are a couple presets you can use, otherwise make your test following the format
```
python main.py
```

Note: If it's ever taking like over 5 seconds to generate (cause you requested 1000 baconians), you can exit the program with Ctrl+C

7. Go to [toebes.com](https://toebes.com/codebusters/TestManage.html) and scroll to the bottom of the page. 
Select 'Import Tests from File' > Select File > Navigate to wherever you cloned the repository > toebees > jsons > yourtest.json

8. Toebes will probably display that your test has a billion errors—just ignore them.
Click 'Randomize Order' on the top left if you wish to randomize.

9. Click 'Test Packet' at the top, then click 'Print'.

10. Save as PDF > email it to yourself using your school gmail account > print it out during 5th period > piss off Mrs. Dudley for using all the printer ink.
## Support

idk google it, or if you're hopelessly lost email lwangx26@gmail.com. please don't ask to add new ciphers, i hate coding


## To-Do (for me)
| Status | Task |
| :---: | :------  |
|❌      | update generation - patristos must be encoded with K1 or K2 |
|❌      | update generation - xenocrypts must be encoded with K1 or K2 |
|❌      | update generation - cryptanalysis of the Nihilist Cipher with a “crib” that is no shorter than double than the length of the keyword used |
|❌      | add new cipher - 5x5 Checkerboard Cipher decode |
|❌      | add new cipher - 5x5 Checkerboard Cipher cryptanalysis |
